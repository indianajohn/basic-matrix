Basic Matrix
============
If you want a free, permissively licensed, peer-reviewed, high-quality Matrix
library, download Eigen:

http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

This repository exists solely for me to practice linear algebra. Don't use it
for your project. It's almost certainly way slower and buggier than Eigen.

Instructions
------------
There are no dependencies. Just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/indianajohn/basic-matrix/
cd basic-matrix
mkdir build
cmake ../
make -j8
make test
```
